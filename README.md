# Project: SplitSmart

People frequently need to split bills when in a collegiate setting or living with roommates. As it is inconvenient and costly to Venmo/PayPal/transfer money every time a purchase is made, people often choose to settle bills with each other monthly or periodically. However, in these scenarios, it quickly becomes complicated to keep track of who owes money to whom, particularly since different purchases might cancel out (i.e. Alice, Bob and Caroline live together; Alice pays for meal 1, Bob for meal 2, Caroline for meal 3). We aim to build a web application that will track customizable split payments for an arbitrary number of users.
